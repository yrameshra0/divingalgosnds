# Diving into Algorithms and Data Structures

Repository hosting varied sets of algorithms and data structures intended towards increasing overall understanding of our favourite topic in computer science.

## Curated algorithms and data structures implemented 
| Name        | Remarks  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| [Trie Datastructure](./src/main/js/trie-data-structure.js)|An ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings  |
| [Multiple stacks within array](./src/main/js/stacks-stuffed-inside-array.js)|Stuffing multiple stacks inside single array and handling shrinking and expanding based over space crunch  |
| [Merge sorted arrays with folding](./src/main/js/merging-sorted-arrays.js)|Merges input sorted arrays to produce sorted array the source array with buffer is modified with result|
| [Searching in rotated sorted array](./src/main/js/searching-rotated-sorted-array.js)|Applying binary search in an sorted array but taking care of rotation by eliminating wasteful paths|
| [Graph node path search](./src/main/java/algosnds/graphnodepathsearch/GraphNodePathSearch.java)|Searches if two nodes are connected and accessible by doing an Breadth First Search from one node terminating at other one or else flagging unsuccessful search|
| [LRU Cache](./src/main/java/algosnds/leastrecentlyusedcache/LRUCache.java)| Least Recently Used Cache implementation using doubly linked list and hash table combination|
| [Minimal Tree](./src/main/js/minimal-tree.js)| Generates binary search tree of minimal height from sorted array in increasing order|
